## PyCitySchools_Challenge


In This challenge, ditrict-wide standardized test results are being analyzed. After extracting ,aggregating and reviewing every student's math and reading scores and various other information of the schools, below is the analysis :

-  Overall passing percentage is better for lower budget spending ranges (per student) that higher budget spending ranges (per student)

-  Overall passing percentage is better in Small (<1000) and Medium (1000-2000) size schools compared to Large (2000 - 5000) sized schools

-  Average Math Score and % Passing Math ( especially) is very low in Bottom 5 performing schools compared to Highest 5 performing schools

-  Charter Schools have better % Overall Passing and % Passing Math compared to District schools. Further Analysis will be helpful to know if 
   these passing rates are better due to better teachers and their teaching methods or due to smaller school size in Charter schools compared 
   to District Schools
